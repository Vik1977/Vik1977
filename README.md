## Hi there üëã
### First time here on github (2024)
### I study music but as a hobby and great passion i explore many braches of tech content, programming, virtualization‚ù§Ô∏è etc... 
### Proud user of linux, after i discovered it thanks to the steam deck that i bought 1 year ago
### After that slowly but constantly i begun converting to it, realizing more and more how windows has been holding me back
### Now i run a desktop whit Mint and a laptop whit Tumbleweed, but this could change beacouse i am very courious
### i am trying to build a sort of homelab to achive a totally self hosted array of services
