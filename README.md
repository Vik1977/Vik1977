## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### First time here on github (2024)
### I study music but as a hobby and great passion i explore anything tech related 
### Proud linux user, after i discovered it thanks to the steam deck that i bought 1 year ago
### After that slowly but constantly i begun converting to it, realizing more and more how windows has been holding me back
### Now i run a desktop whit Mint and a laptop whit Tumbleweed, but this could change beacouse i am a very courious
### As a start i think i will be using this repo to document all my progress for myself and for anyone who could find it useful
