 *this document is mainly for my own track record, i dont expect no one  to read it, at least not before i put it in my resumee*


I always loved to tinker whit computers, learning new things, and getting the best out of what i had in my hands,  
if i have to adress my interests from the beginning i would say it all started with <mark>LEGO`s</mark>, i loved to play with them not so many years ago, and probably i would find it fun still today.  
How do I know that? Well because all of my interests that came afterwards followed the same principle, ___i loved to build things, bring to life new ideas and to problem solve.___  
With the LEGO bricks i wanted to build my little city, so i asked for the various buildings and sets, choosing the one that i tought would help me have a plausible city, I loved the idea of something that resembles the real world but in a menagable form factor.  

Then i remeber, that i learned about **modeling**, train modeling to be precise, i liked it and started to gather informations about it, it didn`t last for long, thinking about it probably it was a system too rigid, there was little to no DIY work, and i think it was not very flexible.  

In the meantime i asked for my desktop PC whit **Windows** during the quarantine, and i remeber spendig days looking for ways to costumize it to my likeing and improving it`s performace. 

And it`s at this point that i think that came the breaktrough,  
as on date: <mark>16 Aug, 2023</mark> after reaserching for a gaming handheld, i asked to have the ___Steam Deck___ for my birthday

Thanks to this i learned about <mark>**linux**</mark>, **SteamOS based on arch**, 
so as i was exploring, tweaking and watching many many tutorials,my understanding growed exponetially  
Shortly after, i got an old laptop from my grandma, a Thoshiba(?), which obviusly could not run windows so i installed linux (Mint) on it, and it was stunning, with an SSD and linux that old computer became fairly usable compared to the choppy windows expirience, with the power of Open-Source and community work.  
 As i countinued gathering information, i stumbled upon the Harvard course: CS50, on youtube, i watched only the first videos beacause after that it was getting a little bit too complicated (i'm looking to come back to that). But even that little theory thoat i got from the introdution helped me have clearer ideas.
###### *By the way they have a site called EDX where you can find the free lesson. nd not only about computer sience, make the assignments, and even, for a small price get a certificate.
### Then i started even telling my mom to ask all the people the she knows if they had old or broken hardweare
### that i could take, disassemble, clean them, put them back toghether.
### And then? Then i got a pile of, practically, rubbish in my home that i didn't know how to use
### so i started searching, to fix the problem, some of the things needed to do a sotering work to be usable
### so i put them aside for the moment, or trown them out if they were the most random things.
### I started working on the most easy things, the functioning devices like the computers,
### by the time of writing at home i have 6 laptops, 2 desktops, the steam deck, a xbox 360 and may routers
 P.S. I need more desktops   
 EDIT: i got too much desktops
### After a bit of resarch i found that to make a little home server you don't need a so powerful PC, at least to start,
### so firstly i tried Ubuntu server, and debian whit no GUI, then i discovered virtualization (God bless virtualization)
### I tred Proxmox, then TrueNas, OpenMediaVault
