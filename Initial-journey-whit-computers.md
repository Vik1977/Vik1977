### As i said i started really looking in depth whit computer related stuff when i got my steam deck,
### before i got my desktop PC whit windows on wich i mainly played on.
### So i think the very important milestone was when i got for the first time in touch whit linux, SteamOS based on arch,
### so as i was exploring, tweaking and watching many many tutorials i started to expand my wiew,
### then i got an old laptop from my grandma, a Thoshiba(?), which obviusly couldn run windows so i installed there linux (mint),
### As i countinued gathering information, i stumbled upon the Harvard course CS50 on youtube,
### i watched only the first videos beacouse after that it was getting a little bit too complicated (i'm looking to come back to that)
### but even that little theory that i got from the introdution helped me have clearer ideas.
### By the way they have a site called EDX where you can find the free lesson,
### and not only about computer sience, make the assignments, and even, for a small price get a certificate.
### Then i started even telling my mom to ask all the people the she knows if they had old or broken hardweare
### that i could take, disassemble, clean them, put them back toghether.
### And then? Then i got a pile of, practically, rubbish in my home that i didn't know how to use
### so i started searching, to fix the problem, some of the things needed to do a sotering work to be usable
### so i put them aside for the moment, or trown them out if they were the most random things.
### I started working on the most easy things, the functioning devices like the computers,
### by the time of writing at home i have 6 laptops, 2 desktops, the steam deck, a xbox 360 and may routers
### P.S. I need more desktops 
### After a bit of resarch i found that to make a little home server you don't need a so powerful PC, at least to start,
### so firstly i tried Ubuntu server, and debian whit no GUI, then i discovered virtualization (God bless virtualization)
### I tred Proxmox, then TrueNas, OpenMediaVault
